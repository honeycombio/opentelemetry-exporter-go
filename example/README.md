# opentelemetry-exporter-go

Pass your Honeycomb API key, found on your Honeycomb Team Settings page and your dataset name to the `NewExporter()` function in main.go. ([Sign up for free](https://ui.honeycomb.io/signup) if you havenâ€™t already!)

Run `go run main.go` to start the example app, enter some text on the command line, then find your traces over on honeycomb.
